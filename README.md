* **Author's contribution**:
    - Kasper Bågmark: Responsibility for the ensemble idea and for a basic setup with TorchDistributor. Investigated scalability.
    - Michele Di Sabato: Provided the first idea of analysis, dataset management and main responsibility of the final code.
    - Erik Jansson: Did a thorough literature review of relevant methods for timeseries and autoencoders. Provided the finalized project idea.
    - Peng Kuang: Investigated scalability, especially for federated learning in general. Provided the docker image and made sure that the collaboration worked smoothly.
    - Selma Tabakovic: Most of the initial investigation of using autoencoders on different datasets and different evaluations of this. Main responsibility of the final data that we used.
    - Everyone: Experimented with setup, autoencoders and timeseries analysis in different ways before the final project was finalized.
